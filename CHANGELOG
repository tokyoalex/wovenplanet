Changes to buggy.cxx

-Removed Word struct due to memory leaks and sort/ count inefficiency - replaced with std::map
-Removed unneccessary static keyword from functions and variables

workerThread()
-added mutex and conditional variable to worker thread so it no longer runs constantly but waits for data to process from the main thread via a std::queue.
-worker thread no longer processes "end" text and instead exits when receives signal (bool) from main thread that EOF or "end" has occurred

-removed deprecated functions and fixed memory leaks. 
-added mutex/ conditional variable processed for sending data to worker thread. 
-added FILE* function parameter to allow unit testing via file
